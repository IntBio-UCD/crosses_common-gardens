# Calculating total fitness for plants planted in 2024
Takes into account 2024 and 2025 data 

Question: Is assisted gene flow better than assisted migration?
-   If so, would expect F1s (half high, half low elev) to perform better than parents 
-   If not, parents would do better than F1s 
-   Also, based on 2023 results would expect High x High F1s to be the worst (esp through first year of life)

## Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

sem <- function(x, na.rm=FALSE) {  #for calculating standard error
  sd(x,na.rm=na.rm)/sqrt(length(na.omit(x)))
} 
```
