# crosses_common-gardens
code for analyzing the common garden data for the years where crosses were planted with their parents in the field.

Note: The first 3 censuses (0618, 0625, and 0703) have the incorrect plant IDs for the 2023 plants. See the size files with "_2023Plants_corrected" at the end for the corrected plant IDs. 
Accordingly, use the 10/23 mort/pheno and annual census files and not the previous dates for those data.
